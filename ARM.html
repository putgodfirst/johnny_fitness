<h2>Triceps (back of arms)</h2>
<p>The pushdown is performed while standing by pushing down on a bar held at the level of the upper chest. It is important to keep the elbows at shoulder width and in line with shoulder/legs.<br> <img src="pushdown.gif" alt="" width="25%" height="25%"><br>
    The triceps extension is performed while standing or seated, by lowering a weight held above the head (keeping the upper arms motionless), and then raising it again. It can be performed with both arms, or one arm at a time. </p><img src="triceps extension.gif" alt="" width="25%" height="25%">
<h2>Biceps (front of arms)</h2>
<p>The Preacher curl is performed while standing or seated, with hands hanging down holding weights (palms facing forwards), by curling them up to the shoulders. It can be performed with both arms, or one arm at a time.<br><img src="preacher curl.gif" alt=""><br>
    The Zottman curl gives a stronger focus to forearm training compared to the traditional curl.<br><img src="zottman curl.gif" alt="">
